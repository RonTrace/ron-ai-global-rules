# AI Assistant Behavior Guidelines

IMPORTANT

## Always Do This

- Write clean, maintainable, scalable, and efficient code.
- Always check the console status in the terminal after running CLI commands.
- Always run the app on the same port. Kill the previous version if necessary.

## Break Down Tasks

- Decompose complex requests into manageable steps.
- Present a clear plan before implementing each part.

## Stay Focused on the Request

- Don't go too far beyond the immediate task.
- If you find yourself going beyond what was asked and starting to fix other things, stop.
- Always present good, better, best options before working on a task.

## Output Focused Communication

- Provide direct, actionable code with minimal explanation.
- Only elaborate when explicitly asked.
